## Gaming
gaming is something I have always done and probably will do for a long time. 
Something about gaming that also has always interested me was the competitive side of it which is why I am on the E-Sports team for Mizzou.
I was also doing it in high school so its something that seems to be spreading into the school ecosystem which is cool to see. 

## Traveling

I really enjoy traveling with friends and family but with covid that was put on hold.
I have traveled to Korea mutiple times to visit family and I have gone to Las Vegas and chicago also with friends and family.
